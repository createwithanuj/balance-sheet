# balance-sheet

## Project Overview

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum, where I built a **Balance Sheet** using **CSS Pseudo Selectors**. The goal was to demonstrate how to style specific HTML elements dynamically by using pseudo selectors like `:hover`, `:nth-child()`, and `:before`. These techniques allow for more interactive and responsive web designs.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Hover Effects**: When you hover over specific elements, their appearance changes, making the page more dynamic and user-friendly.
- **Event Triggers**: CSS pseudo selectors are used to trigger events like highlighting rows or columns when certain conditions are met.
- **Responsiveness**: The balance sheet is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

## What I Learned

- How to apply **CSS pseudo selectors** to control the style of elements based on user interactions and their position in the DOM.
- Techniques for triggering different CSS styles using `:hover` and `:nth-child()`.
- How to use **pseudo-elements** like `:before` and `:after` to add content to a webpage without modifying the HTML structure.
